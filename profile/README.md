## Hi there 👋


# 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

- Kepler (Kubernetes-based Efficient Power Level Exporter) uses eBPF to probe energy related system stats and exports as Prometheus metrics 
- PEAKS (Power Efficiency Aware Kubernetes Scheduler) uses metrics exported by Kepler to help Kubernetes schedule to improve energy efficiency by placing Pods on optimal nodes.
- CLEVER (Container Level Energy-efficient VPA Recommender) uses metrics exported by Kepler to recommend Vertical Pod Autoscaler the resource profiles to improve energy efficiency by running workloads.
